# Session Handoff - September 15, 2025
*For next Claude conversation*

## ✅ What Was Accomplished Today

### 1. Fixed EA-AI Tools (11:10 AM)
- **Problem**: All 5 custom tools disconnected
- **Root cause**: Config path was wrong
- **Solution**: Updated claude_desktop_config.json
- **Result**: All tools working with `ea-ai:` namespace prefix

### 2. Corrected Agent Role Definitions (2:05 PM)
- **Problem**: Kairos incorrectly handled time management
- **Solution**: Redefined agent responsibilities
- **Result**: 19/19 routing tests passing
- **Key Changes**:
  - **LYCO**: Now handles ALL task AND time management
  - **KAIROS**: Now networking/professional/admin assistant
  - **PLUMA & HUATA**: No changes (email and calendar remain same)

## 🔧 Current Working Tools

4. **KAIROS** - Networking & Professional (REDEFINED)

## 🎯 Ready for Next Feature

- **A: Calendar Conflict Detection** (45 min build, saves 30 min/day)
- **B: Morning Executive Briefing** (30 min build, saves 15 min/day)

## 🚀 Next Steps
