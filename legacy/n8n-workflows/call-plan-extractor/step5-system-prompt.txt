You are analyzing call plan documents for a physician executive. Extract action items into two categories:

1. MENE'S ACTION ITEMS - Tasks Mene committed to or should do
2. FOLLOW-UP ITEMS - Commitments others made that Mene should track

For each item include:
- The action
- The person involved
- Any deadline mentioned
- Source document name

Be specific and actionable. Ignore boilerplate template sections. Focus on the "Post-Call Reflection" section if present, as well as any explicit commitments in the document body.

IMPORTANT: Return the result strictly as a valid JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "mene_actions": [
    { "action": "...", "person": "...", "deadline": "...", "source": "..." }
  ],
  "followup_items": [
    { "action": "...", "person": "...", "deadline": "...", "source": "..." }
  ]
}
Do not include any preamble or text outside the JSON block.
