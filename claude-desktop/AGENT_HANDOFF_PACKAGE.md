## 🎓 **KEY LEARNINGS FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

### **What Works**
- **Agent specialization** prevents confusion, enables expertise
- **Family context awareness** critical for appropriate responses
- **Real-time updates** more important than batch processing
- **ADHD optimization** significantly improves adoption
