# 🎉 Family Update: Au Pair Scheduling Now Active!

## What Changed
The Demestihas AI now handles Viola's schedule automatically. No more spreadsheet updates or separate texts needed!

## Who Benefits
**Everyone** - But especially parents managing childcare coverage

## How to Use It

### For Parents (Mene & Cindy)

Just text @LycurgusBot naturally:

**Mark Viola's Time Off:**
- "Viola has Thursday off"
- "Viola out Friday afternoon"
- "Viola off next Monday"

**Request Coverage:**
- "Need coverage tomorrow 3-5pm"
- "Date night Saturday, need childcare"
- "Coverage needed Tuesday evening"

**Check Schedule:**
- "What's Viola's schedule this week?"
- "Is Viola working tomorrow?"
- "Show me Viola's schedule"

**Track Overtime:**
- "Viola worked extra 3 hours Saturday"
- "Viola stayed late 2 hours"

### For Kids
You don't need to do anything different! The system knows when Viola is available to help with homework or activities.

### For Viola
Your schedule is now digitally tracked. You'll receive:
- Confirmation when schedule changes
- Coverage requests directly
- Overtime/comp time tracking
- (Coming soon: WhatsApp notifications)

## What Happens Automatically

When you say "Viola has Friday off":
1. ✅ System marks Friday as unavailable
2. ✅ Checks if it's a school day
3. ✅ Creates a coverage task if needed
4. ✅ Adds to family task list
5. ✅ (Coming soon: Notifies Viola via WhatsApp)

## Examples That Work Now

**Parent**: "Viola has tomorrow off"
**Bot**: "✅ Marked Viola as off for Thursday, Aug 28. Coverage task created for school day."

**Parent**: "We need coverage Saturday evening for date night"
**Bot**: "✅ Coverage request created for Saturday evening. Viola has been notified."

**Parent**: "What's Viola's schedule?"
**Bot**: Shows this week's schedule with any changes highlighted

## Coming Next Week

- **Phase 2**: See Viola's schedule in Google Calendar
- **Phase 3**: Direct WhatsApp messages to Viola

## If Something Goes Wrong

1. The old way still works - you can always text Viola directly
2. Check the schedule with "What's Viola's schedule?"
3. Report issues with "That didn't work" and the bot will log it

## Why This Works

- **ADHD-Friendly**: One command does everything
- **No Cognitive Load**: System handles all the steps
- **Proactive**: Detects gaps before they become problems
- **Time-Saving**: 30 seconds → 2 seconds

## Privacy Note
All schedule data is private to our family. Viola's personal time is never tracked, only work schedule.
