# 🎉 Your AI Assistant Just Got Smarter!

## What's New (Starting Today)

Your task bot now **remembers context** from your conversation. No more repeating yourself!

### New Magic That Works

Send these commands naturally:
- **"Buy milk tomorrow"** → Creates task with correct date
- **"Make that urgent"** → Updates your last task to 🔥 priority  
- **"Actually, change that to next week"** → Adjusts the date
- **"What did I just ask?"** → Bot recalls your recent request

### Real Example to Try Now

1. Send: `Schedule dentist appointment`
2. Then: `Make that urgent` 
3. Then: `Add a note about the crown`
4. Check Notion - same task updated each time!

## What Hasn't Changed

- Same @LycurgusBot in Telegram
- Same task categories in Notion  
- Same quick responses
- All your existing tasks intact

## Rolling Out to Family

**Today**: You're testing (let me know any issues)
**Tomorrow**: Adding Cindy if stable
**Day 3**: Kids can start using simple commands
**This Week**: Viola gets scheduling features

## Quick Test Commands

Try these to see the magic:
```
Buy groceries tomorrow
Make that urgent
Actually make it today instead
```

## Known Improvements
