# Document 4: Family Communication Patterns
**Source:** Inferred from Notion tasks, calendar, and family context
**Note:** Since message access unavailable, patterns derived from task creation and coordination visible in other systems

## Communication Styles by Family Member

### Mene (You) - Direct & Action-Oriented
**Task Creation Style:**
- Brief, imperative statements: "Buy milk", "Review application"
- Corrections are decisive: "Actually make that urgent"
- Natural delegation awareness: Notes when Viola can handle
- Time references often relative: "tomorrow", "by EOD"

**Observed Patterns:**
- Creates tasks throughout the day (early morning to late evening)
- Often batches related items (multiple grocery items in sequence)
- Uses bot heavily for routine items, manual for complex tasks
- Quick to mark completions

### Cindy - Collaborative Approach
**Visible in Tasks:**
- Co-assigned on family/household items
- Created task about Persephone's orthodontist (medical coordination)
- Included in financial planning (Alleson meeting)
- Weekly check-ins suggest equal partnership in planning

**Coordination Patterns:**
- Medical appointments for kids
- Household shopping decisions
- Family event planning
- Au pair schedule management

### Viola (Au Pair) - Task Recipient
**Delegation Patterns:**
- "Buy more fruits from Publix" - originally assigned to her
- Shopping errands when delegatable
- Implied coverage needs in calendar gaps
- Weekly check-in suggests formal communication structure

**Communication Needs:**
- Clear, specific instructions
- Advance notice for schedule changes
- Written confirmation of responsibilities
- Professional but warm tone

### Kids (Mentioned in Context)
**School-Related Patterns:**
- Persephone (Persy): Orthodontist, likely Sutton school items
- Spirit Day coordination (Stelios, Franci at E. Rivers)
- Carpool/pickup logistics
- Activity coordination (soccer, school events)

## Task Communication Patterns

### Urgent/Important Signals
**Explicit:**
- "do now" directly stated
- "make that urgent" as correction
- Due dates when critical

**Implicit:**
- Medical appointments = high priority
- School deadlines = non-negotiable
- "Review" tasks = professional importance
- Grocery items = routine unless specified

### Delegation Decision Tree
```
Is it shopping? 
  → Simple items: Can delegate to Viola
  → Specific brands/complex: Mene or Cindy

Is it kid-related?
  → Medical: Cindy coordinates
  → School events: Shared responsibility
  → Activities: Whoever's available

Is it professional?
  → Always Mene
  → Reviews, applications, networking

Is it household?
  → Routine: Viola
  → Decisions needed: Mene & Cindy together
```

## Coordination Mechanisms

### Calendar as Communication
- Recurring meetings = protected time
- All-day events = reminders/deadlines
- Shared calendars (Limon y Sal) = couple coordination
- School calendar integration expected

### Task System as Family Hub
- Shared grocery lists
- Event planning tasks
- Chore distribution (implied)
- Schedule coordination

### Weekly Rhythms
- Monday: Week planning (Alleson meeting sets tone)
- Tuesday-Thursday: Execution days
- Friday: Wrap-up and weekend prep
- Saturday: Family planning meeting
- Sunday: Family time (few scheduled items)

## Language Patterns

### Task Phrasing Variations
**Mene's Patterns:**
- "Buy [item]" - direct
- "Review [document]" - professional
- "Add [item] to [list]" - systematic
- "Schedule [event]" - planning ahead

**Family Coordination Language:**
- "Get coverage for..." - childcare needs
- "Sign up for..." - volunteer commitments
- "Support/donate" - community involvement
- "Optional family..." - inclusive but flexible

### Correction/Update Patterns
1. Initial creation (often generic)
2. Quick correction/addition
3. Priority adjustment
4. Assignment clarification
5. Context tags added

Example flow:
- "Review application" 
- → "Review Consilium application"
- → "Actually make that urgent"
- → Assigned to Mene
- → Tagged: Work, Admin, Quick Win

## Testing Scenarios

### Multi-Person Coordination
"Find a time when Cindy and I are both free for dinner"
"Schedule soccer pickup when Viola or Cindy can do it"
"Plan family movie night when everyone's available"

### Delegation Decisions
"Add milk to the list" → Who should buy?
"Persy needs soccer gear" → Who handles?
"Kitchen supplies running low" → Bulk buy or regular?

### Schedule Negotiation
"Move my Tuesday appointment" → Needs 1 week notice
"Reschedule family meeting" → Saturday 9 PM is sacred
"Find coverage for Thursday morning" → Carpool conflict

### Natural Family Phrases
"The kids need..."
"For school tomorrow..."
"Viola's off that day..."
"Cindy mentioned..."
"After soccer practice..."
"Before the school thing..."

## Communication Friction Points

### Observed Challenges
- Everything marked as "🔥 Do Now" (priority inflation)
- Time estimates often missing (ADHD time blindness)
- Context switching between family/work in same session
- Ambiguous ownership on household tasks

### System Should Help With
1. **Priority Reality Check:** "Everything can't be urgent"
2. **Time Estimation:** Suggest based on task type
3. **Context Grouping:** Batch related items
4. **Clear Ownership:** Explicit assignment rules
5. **Gentle Reminders:** ADHD-friendly nudges

## Family Dynamics to Test

### Scenario 1: Morning Rush
"Kids need spirit wear today, Viola's running carpool, I have early meeting"
- Multiple actors
- Time pressure
- Coordination critical

### Scenario 2: Weekend Planning
"Soccer game Saturday, family dinner out, need groceries, Viola wants Sunday off"
- Competing priorities
- Schedule Tetris
- Family negotiation

### Scenario 3: School Communication
"Field trip tomorrow needs permission slip, lunch money, volunteer parent"
- Multiple todo items
- Deadline driven
- Parent coordination

### Scenario 4: Household Management
"Running low on essentials, Costco run needed, but who has time?"
- Delegation decision
- Bulk vs regular shopping
- Schedule availability

- Assigns school tasks to appropriate parent
- Suggests Viola for delegatable errands
- Protects family time blocks
- Groups related tasks together
- Maintains professional/family boundaries
