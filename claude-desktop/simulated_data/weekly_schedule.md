## Testing Scenarios for Beta

### Calendar Query Tests
1. "Am I free Thursday morning?" → Should note carpool duty
2. "Can I schedule something Tuesday at noon?" → Conflict with Karen
3. "What do I have on Monday?" → Alleson check-in
4. "When can I do deep work this week?" → Wed/Fri optimal
5. "Find time for dentist appointment" → Avoid recurring commitments

### Schedule Coordination Tests
1. "Schedule meeting with John when we're both free"
2. "Find 2 hours for Consilium review this week"
3. "When is Viola available for kids coverage?"
4. "Book family dinner avoiding conflicts"

### Natural Language Time Tests
- "tomorrow afternoon"
- "next Tuesday morning"
- "sometime next week"
- "after the school thing Thursday"
- "before my recurring appointment"

## Weekly Rhythm Insights

### Energy Management Visible
- Important meetings early in week (Monday)
- Self-care mid-week (Tuesday therapy)
- Community service when energized (Thursday AM)
- Family planning when relaxed (Saturday PM)

### Flexibility Patterns
- Wednesday and Friday notably open
- Suggests either:
  - Kept free for ad-hoc needs
  - Clinical shifts (not on calendar)
  - Deep work protection

### Support System Structure
- Financial advisor (Alleson)
- Therapist (Karen)
- Au pair (Viola)
- Spouse coordination (Cindy)
- Shows comprehensive support network

## Beta Testing Implications

The calendar shows:
1. **Protected time blocks** that shouldn't be moved
2. **Natural work windows** for task scheduling
3. **Family coordination needs** requiring multi-person availability
4. **Community commitments** that affect availability
5. **Recurring patterns** the system should recognize

Test the beta's ability to:
- Respect protected time (therapy)
- Identify open windows (Wed/Fri)
- Handle recurring events properly
- Understand "next week" in context
- Coordinate multi-person scheduling
