## Your Natural Speaking Patterns (from real transcripts)

### Stream-of-Consciousness Style
When recording voice memos, you tend to:
- Jump between related topics without explicit transitions
- Use incomplete sentences that make sense in context
- Reference previous conversations or decisions
- Include contextual asides and clarifications

### Common Voice Memo Structures

#### 1. Meeting Notes Pattern
```
"Growing into far reaches of metro atlanta
Taking over the state
1-2 providers to 2-3 in the city
3 provider = 100 pt/day"
```
- Bullet-style mental notes
- Numerical data points scattered throughout
- Industry-specific terminology without explanation
- Quick calculations and comparisons

#### 2. Decision Documentation Pattern
```
"Alternate - 3-6m - Oct/Nov
Collaborative - few weeks?
No minimum requirements"
```
- Timeline references
- Question marks for uncertainty
- Brief labels for complex concepts
- Action items mixed with observations

#### 3. Reflection/Analysis Pattern
From termination meeting notes:
- "What happened?" → factual summary
- "What was really being said?" → interpretation
- Legal/strategic considerations
- Personal impact assessment

### Task Extraction Challenges from Voice

#### Ambiguous References
- "that thing we discussed" 
- "the application" (which one?)
- "review the paperwork" (for what?)
- "follow up on..." (with whom?)

#### Mixed Priorities in Single Recording
- Urgent items buried in routine updates
- Personal tasks mixed with professional
- Family logistics intertwined with work

#### Time References
- "tomorrow" (when was recording made?)
- "next week's meeting" (which meeting?)
- "after the thing on Thursday"
- "when I get back from..."

### Successful Extraction Patterns

#### Clear Action Items
- "I need to call [specific person] about [specific topic]"
- "Buy [item] from [store] by [date]"
- "Schedule meeting with [person] to discuss [topic]"
- "Review [specific document] before [deadline]"

#### Context Clues for Priority
- "This is on fire" = urgent
- "When you get a chance" = low priority  
- "By EOD" = today but flexible
- "ASAP" = drop everything
- "[Person] is waiting on this" = high priority

#### Natural Delegation Indicators
- "Can Viola handle..."
- "This is more Cindy's thing"
- "Kids can do this one"
- "I'll take care of..."

### Voice-Specific Phrases You Use

#### Starting a Thought
- "So basically..."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "I'm thinking..."
- "Need to remember..."

#### Connecting Ideas
- "Also..."
- "Speaking of which..."
- "Related to that..."
- "Oh and..."

#### Uncertainty Markers
- "I think it was..."
- "Maybe around..."
- "Possibly we could..."
- "Not sure but..."

### Multi-Task Dumps
Common pattern in your recordings:
1. Start with most pressing item
2. Remember related tasks
3. Jump to different context
4. Circle back to original topic
5. Add clarifications at end

Example flow:
"Need to review Consilium paperwork... oh and Piedmont too... actually make the Consilium one priority... also check with Will about those intros... wait, did I schedule the orthodontist cancellation?"

### Meeting Note Patterns

#### Information Density
- Multiple data points per sentence
- Abbreviations and shortcuts
- Numbers without units (context implied)
- People referenced by first name only

#### Follow-up Extraction
- Action items often implicit, not stated
- "Teaching Role" = investigate teaching opportunity
- "$250 daily stipend" = negotiate or accept?
- "3-6m" = timeline to plan around

### Recommended Processing Approach

For your voice memos, the beta should:
1. **Identify recording context** (meeting, solo planning, family coordination)
2. **Extract all potential tasks** (even uncertain ones)
3. **Flag ambiguous references** for clarification
4. **Group related items** that were mentioned separately
5. **Infer priority** from tone and context
6. **Suggest task owner** based on content type
